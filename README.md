# Help-Boost-Our-Online-Reach

### About
The task is to identify the relevant, high-quality web pages from a pool of usercurated web pages to identify “ad-worthy” web pages. The challenge required us
to build large-scale, end-to-end machine learning models that can classify a website as either “relevant” or “irrelevant” , based on attributes such as
alchemy category and its score, meta-information of the web pages, and a one-line description of the content of each webpage. To facilitate this, the
agency has created a dataset of raw Html, meta statistics, and a binary label for each webpage. The binary label represents whether the webpage was selected
for ad placement or not.
